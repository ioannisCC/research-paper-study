During my Erasmus exchange program at Stockholm University, my colleagues and I conducted a study on the effect of web design on user attention and information retention. This study was conducted as part of the Cognitive Psychology in Human-Computer Interaction course. Our findings show how eye tracking technology provides valuable insights into user behavior and web design optimization.
